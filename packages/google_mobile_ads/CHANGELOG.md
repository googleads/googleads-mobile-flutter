## 0.11.0
Open beta release of the Google Mobile Ads Flutter plugin.
Please see the [README](https://github.com/googleads/googleads-mobile-flutter/blob/master/README.md) for updated integration steps.

* Package and file names have been renamed from `firebase_admob` to `google_mobile_ads`.

* Removes support for legacy plugin APIs.

* Removes Firebase dependencies.

* Adds support for `RequestConfiguration` targeting APIs.

* Adds support for Ad Manager key values, via the new `Publisher` ad containers.
See `PublisherBannerAd` and similar classes.

* Shows warning if an `Ad` object is reused without being disposed.

* Removes support for V1 embedding.

* Add version to request agent.

## 0.10.0

* Old Plugin API has been moved to `lib/firebase_admob_legacy.dart`. To keep using the old API change
`import 'package:firebase_admob/firebase_admob.dart';` to
`import 'package:firebase_admob/firebase_admob_legacy.dart';`.

* Updated `RewardedAd` to the latest API. Instantiating and displaying a `RewardedAd` is now similar
to`InterstitialAd`. See README for more info. A simple example is shown below.
```dart
final RewardedAd myRewardedAd = RewardedAd(
  adUnitId: RewardedAd.testAdUnitId,
  request: AdRequest(),
  listener: AdListener(
    onAdLoaded: (Ad ad) => (ad as RewardedAd).show(),
  ),
);
myRewardedAd.load();
```

* Replacement of `MobileAdEvent` callbacks with improved `AdListener`.
```dart
BannerAd(
 listener: (MobileAdEvent event) {
   print("BannerAd event $event");
 },
);
```

can be replaced by:

```dart
BannerAd(
  listener: AdListener(
    onAdLoaded: (Ad ad) => print('$BannerAd loaded.'),
    onAdFailedToLoad: (Ad ad) => print('$BannerAd failed to load.'),
  ),
);
```

* `MobileAdTargeting` has been renamed to `AdRequest` to keep consistent with SDK.
* `MobileAd` has been renamed to `Ad`.

* Fix smart banners on iOS.
  - `AdSize.smartBanner` is for Android only.
  - `AdSize.smartBannerPortrait` and `AdSize.smartBannerLandscape` are only for iOS.
  - Use `Adsize.getSmartBanner(Orientation)` to get the correct value depending on platform. The
  orientation can be retrieved using a `BuildContext`:
```dart
Orientation currentOrientation = MediaQuery.of(context).orientation;
```

* Removal of `show()` for `BannerAd` and `NativeAd` since they can now be displayed within a widget
tree.
* Showing of `InterstitialAd` and `RewardedAd` should now wait for `AdListener.onAdLoaded` callback
before calling `show()` as best practice:

```dart
InterstitialAd(
  adUnitId: InterstitialAd.testAdUnitId,
  targetingInfo: targetingInfo,
  listener: (MobileAdEvent event) {
    print("InterstitialAd event $event");
  },
)
  ..load()
  ..show();
```

can be replaced by:

```dart
final InterstatialAd interstitial = InterstatialAd(
  adUnitId: InterstatialAd.testAdUnitId,
  request: AdRequest(),
  listener: AdListener(
    onAdLoaded: (Ad ad) => (ad as InterstatialAd).show(),
  ),
)..load();
```

* `Ad.load()` no longer returns a boolean that only confirms the method was called successfully.

## 0.9.3+4

* Bump Dart version requirement.

## 0.9.3+3
