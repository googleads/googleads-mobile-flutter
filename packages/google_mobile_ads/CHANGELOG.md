## 3.0.0
* Adds support for `MobileAds.registerWebView()`. This API supports in-app ad monetization for
  `WebView`s. You can read more in the [android](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/webview)
  or [iOS](https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/webview) documentation.
  This plugin now depends on [webview_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/webview_flutter), 
  [webview_flutter_wkwebview](https://pub.dev/packages/webview_flutter_wkwebview), and 
  [webview_flutter_android](https://pub.dev/packages/webview_flutter_android)
* Updates Android GMA dependency to 22.0.0 and iOS dependency to 10.4.0
* Fixes https://github.com/googleads/googleads-mobile-flutter/issues/700

## 2.4.0
* Adds support for native templates, which are predefined layouts for native ads.
  * `NativeAd` has a new optional parameter, `nativeTemplateStyle` of type `NativeTemplateStyle`.
    If provided, the plugin will inflate and style a platform native ad view for you, instead of
    requiring you to write and register a NativeAdFactory (android) or FLTNativeAdFactory (iOS).
* Adds a new flag, AdWidget.optOutOfVisibilityDetectorWorkaround. Setting this to true
  lets you opt out of the fix added for https://github.com/googleads/googleads-mobile-flutter/issues/580,
  which was resolved in Flutter 3.7.0.

## 2.3.0
* Updates GMA iOS dependency to 9.13
* Updates GMA Android dependency to 21.3.0
* Updates request agent string based on metadata in AndroidManifest.xml or Info.plist

## 2.2.0
* Updates GMA iOS dependency to 9.11.0. This fixes dependency issues in apps that
  also depend on the latest version of Firebase: https://github.com/googleads/googleads-mobile-flutter/issues/673
* Adds the field `responseExtras` to `ResponseInfo`. See `ResponseInfo` docs:
  * https://developers.google.com/admob/flutter/response-info
  * https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/mobile-ads-sdk/flutter/response-info
* Fixes a crash introduced in 2.1.0, [issue #675](https://github.com/googleads/googleads-mobile-flutter/issues/675)

## 2.1.0
* Updates GMA dependencies to 21.2.0 (Android) and 9.10.0 (iOS):
* Adds `loadedAdapterResponseInfo` to `ResponseInfo` and the following fields to
  `AdapterResponseInfo`:
  * adSourceID
  * adSourceInstanceId
  * adSourceInstanceName
  * adSourceName
* Fixes [close button issue on iOS](https://github.com/googleads/googleads-mobile-flutter/issues/191)
## 2.0.1
* Bug fix for [issue 580](https://github.com/googleads/googleads-mobile-flutter/issues/580).
  Adds a workaround on Android to wait for the ad widget to become visible
  before attaching the platform view.

## 2.0.0
* Updates GMA Android dependency to 21.0.0 and iOS to 9.6.0
* Removes `credentials` from `AdapterResponseInfo`, which is replaced with
  `adUnitMapping`.
* Removes `serverSideVerificationOptions` from `RewardedAd.load()` and 
  `RewardedInterstitialAd.load()`, replacing them with setters 
  `RewardedAd.setServerSideVerificationOptions()` and 
  `RewardedInterstitialAd.setServerSideVerificationOptions()`. This lets you
  update the ssv after the ad is loaded.
* Removes static `testAdUnitId` parameters. See the
  [Admob](https://developers.google.com/admob/flutter/test-ads) and 
  [AdManager](https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/mobile-ads-sdk/flutter/test-ads)
  documentation for up to date test ad units.
* Removes `NativeAdListener.onNativeAdClicked`. You should use `onAdClicked`
  instead, which present on all ad listeners.
* Removes `AdRequest.location`

## 1.3.0
* Adds support for programmatically opening the debug options menu using`MobileAds.openDebugMenu(String adUnitId)`
* Adds support for Ad inspector APIs. See the [AdMob](https://developers.google.com/admob/flutter/ad-inspector)
  and [Ad Manager](https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/mobile-ads-sdk/flutter/ad-inspector)
  sites for integration guides.
* Adds support for User Messaging Platform. See the [AdMob](https://developers.google.com/admob/flutter/eu-consent)
  and [Ad Manager](https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/mobile-ads-sdk/flutter/eu-consent)
  sites for integration guides.

## 1.2.0
* Set new minimum height for `FluidAdWidget`.
  This is required after Flutter v2.11.0-0.1.pre because Android platform views
  that have no size don't load.
* Update GMA Android dependency to 20.6.0 and iOS to 8.13.0.
  * [Android release notes](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/rel-notes)
  * [iOS release notes](https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/rel-notes)
* Deprecate `AdapterResponseInfo.credentials` in favor of `adUnitMapping`
* Deprecates `LocationParams` in `AdRequest` and `AdManagerAdRequest`.

## 1.1.0
* Adds support for [Rewarded Interstitial](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/9884467) (beta) ad format.
* Adds support for `onAdClicked` events to all ad formats. `NativeAdListener.onNativeAdClicked` is now deprecated.
  * `FullScreenContentCallback` and `AdWithViewListeners` now have an `onAdClicked` event.
## 1.0.1

* Fix for [Issue 449](https://github.com/googleads/googleads-mobile-flutter/issues/449).
  In `LocationParams`, time is now treated as an optional parameter on Android.
* Fix for [Issue 447](https://github.com/googleads/googleads-mobile-flutter/issues/447),
  which affected mediation networks that require an Activity to be initialized on Android.

## 1.0.0

* Mediation is now supported in beta.
  * There are new APIs to support passing network extras to mediation adapters:
    * [MediationNetworkExtrasProvider](https://github.com/googleads/googleads-mobile-flutter/blob/master/packages/google_mobile_ads/android/src/main/java/io/flutter/plugins/googlemobileads/MediationNetworkExtrasProvider.java)
      on Android and [FLTMediationNetworkExtrasProvider](https://github.com/googleads/googleads-mobile-flutter/blob/master/packages/google_mobile_ads/ios/Classes/FLTConstants.h) on iOS
  * See the mediation example app [README](https://github.com/googleads/googleads-mobile-flutter/blob/master/packages/mediation_example/README.md)
    for more details on how to use these APIs.

* Fix for Android 12 issue [#330](https://github.com/googleads/googleads-mobile-flutter/issues/330)
  * This will break compilation on android if you do not already set `compileSdkVersion` to `31`, or override the WorkManager dependency to < 2.7.0:
      ```
      dependencies {
          implementation('androidx.work:work-runtime') {
              version {
                  strictly '2.6.0'
              }
          }
      }
      ```
* Fixes issue [#404](https://github.com/googleads/googleads-mobile-flutter/issues/404)
  * Adds a new dart class, `AppStateEventNotifier`. You should subscribe to `AppStateEventNotifier.appStateStream`
    instead of using `WidgetsBindingObserver` to listen to app foreground/background events.
  * See the app open [example app](https://github.com/googleads/googleads-mobile-flutter/tree/master/packages/app_open_example) for a reference
    on how to use the new API.

* Adds a new parameter `extras` to `AdRequest` and `AdManagerAdRequest`.
  * This can be used to pass additional signals to the AdMob adapter, such as
    [CCPA](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/ccpa) signals.
  * For example, to notify Google that [RDP](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/ccpa#rdp_signal)
    should be enabled when constructing an ad request:
    ```dart
      AdRequest request = AdRequest(extras: {'rdp': '1'});
    ```

## 0.13.6

* Partial fix for [#265](https://github.com/googleads/googleads-mobile-flutter/issues/265).
  * The partial fix allows you to load ads from a cached flutter engine in the add to app scenario,
    but it only works the first time the engine is attached to an activity.
  * Support for reusing the engine in another activity after the first one is destroyed is blocked
    by this Flutter issue which affects all platform views: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/88880.
* Adds support for getRequestConfiguration API
  * [Android API reference](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/ads/MobileAds#public-static-requestconfiguration-getrequestconfiguration)
  * [iOS API reference](https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/api/reference/Classes/GADMobileAds#requestconfiguration)
* Adds support for Fluid Ad Size (Ad Manager only)
  * Fluid ads dynamically adjust their height based on their width. To help display them we've added a new
    ad container, `FluidAdManagerBannerAd`, and a new widget `FluidAdWidget`.
  * You can see the [fluid_example.dart](https://github.com/googleads/googleads-mobile-flutter/blob/master/packages/google_mobile_ads/example/lib/fluid_example.dart) for a reference of how to load and display a fluid ad.
  * [Android API reference](https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/mobile-ads-sdk/android/native/styles#fluid_size)
  * [iOS API reference](https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/mobile-ads-sdk/ios/native/native-styles#fluid_size)
* Adds `AdSize.getCurrentOrientationAnchoredAdaptiveBannerAdSize()` to support getting an `AnchoredAdaptiveBannerAdSize` in the current orientation.
  * Previously the user had to specify an orientation (portrait / landscape) to create an AnchoredAdaptiveBannerAdSize. It has been made optional with this version. SDK will determine the current orientation of the device and return an appropriate AdSize.
  * More information on anchored adaptive banners can be found here:
    * [Admob android](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/banner/anchored-adaptive)
    * [Admob iOS](https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/banner/anchored-adaptive)
    * [Ad manager android](https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/mobile-ads-sdk/android/banner/anchored-adaptive)
    * [Ad manager iOS](https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/mobile-ads-sdk/ios/banner/anchored-adaptive)
* Adds support for inline adaptive banner ads.
  * Inline adaptive banner ads are meant to be used in scrollable content. They are of variable height and can be as tall as the device screen.
    They differ from Fluid ads in that they only resize once when the ad is loaded.
    You can see the [inline_adaptive_example.dart](https://github.com/googleads/googleads-mobile-flutter/blob/master/packages/google_mobile_ads/example/lib/inline_adaptive_example.dart) for a reference of how to load and display
    inline adaptive banners.

    * [Ad manager iOS](https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/mobile-ads-sdk/ios/banner/inline-adaptive)
* Fix for [#369](https://github.com/googleads/googleads-mobile-flutter/issues/369)
  * Fixes setting the app volume in android (doesn't affect iOS).
* Adds support for setting location in `AdRequest` and `AdManagerAdRequest`.
  * Both `AdRequest` and `AdManagerAdRequest` have a new param, `location`.
  * Location data is not used to target Google Ads, but may be used by 3rd party ad networks.
  * See other packages for getting the location. For example, https://pub.dev/packages/location.
* Adds `publisherProvidedId` to `AdManagerAdRequest` to support [publisher provided ids](https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/2880055).

## 0.13.5

* Adds support for app open.
  * Implementation guidance can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/admob/flutter/app-open).
  * As a reference please also see the [example app](https://github.com/googleads/googleads-mobile-flutter/tree/master/packages/app_open_example).

* Renames APIs that use the `Publisher` prefix to `AdManager`.
* Rewarded and Interstitial ads now provide static `load` methods and a new `FullScreenContentCallback` for full screen events.
* Native ads use [GADNativeAdView](https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/mobile-ads-sdk/ios/api/reference/Classes/GADNativeAdView) for iOS
and [NativeAdView](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/ads/nativead/NativeAdView) on Android.
* Adds support for [ResponseInfo](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/response-info).
* Adds support for [same app key](https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/ios14#same_app_key) on iOS.
* Removes `testDevices` from `AdRequest`. Use `MobileAds.updateRequestConfiguration` to set test device ids.
* Removes `Ad.isLoaded()`. Instead you should use the `onAdLoaded` callback to track whether an ad is loaded.
* Removes need to call `Ad.dispose()` for Rewarded and Interstitial ads when they fail to load.

## 0.12.2+1

* Fix anchored adaptive banner message corruption error.
* Update example app with better practices and adaptive banner.

## 0.12.2

* Fixes bug that displayed "This AdWidget is already in the Widget tree".
* Update minimum gradle version.
* Add references to the [codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/admob-inline-ads-in-flutter#0) in the README.

## 0.11.0+1

* Improve AdRequest documentation and fix README heading.

## 0.11.0
Open beta release of the Google Mobile Ads Flutter plugin.
Please see the [README](https://github.com/googleads/googleads-mobile-flutter/blob/master/README.md) for updated integration steps.

* Package and file names have been renamed from `firebase_admob` to `google_mobile_ads`.

* Removes support for legacy plugin APIs.

* Removes Firebase dependencies.

* Adds support for `RequestConfiguration` targeting APIs.

* Adds support for Ad Manager key values, via the new `Publisher` ad containers.
See `PublisherBannerAd` and similar classes.

* Shows warning if an `Ad` object is reused without being disposed.

* Removes support for V1 embedding.

* Add version to request agent.

## 0.10.0

* Old Plugin API has been moved to `lib/firebase_admob_legacy.dart`. To keep using the old API change
`import 'package:firebase_admob/firebase_admob.dart';` to
`import 'package:firebase_admob/firebase_admob_legacy.dart';`.

* Updated `RewardedAd` to the latest API. Instantiating and displaying a `RewardedAd` is now similar
to`InterstitialAd`. See README for more info. A simple example is shown below.
```dart
final RewardedAd myRewardedAd = RewardedAd(
  adUnitId: RewardedAd.testAdUnitId,
  request: AdRequest(),
  listener: AdListener(
    onAdLoaded: (Ad ad) => (ad as RewardedAd).show(),
  ),
);
myRewardedAd.load();
```

* Replacement of `MobileAdEvent` callbacks with improved `AdListener`.
```dart
BannerAd(
 listener: (MobileAdEvent event) {
   print("BannerAd event $event");
 },
);
```

can be replaced by:

```dart
BannerAd(
  listener: AdListener(
    onAdLoaded: (Ad ad) => print('$BannerAd loaded.'),
    onAdFailedToLoad: (Ad ad) => print('$BannerAd failed to load.'),
  ),
);
```

* `MobileAdTargeting` has been renamed to `AdRequest` to keep consistent with SDK.
* `MobileAd` has been renamed to `Ad`.

* Fix smart banners on iOS.
  - `AdSize.smartBanner` is for Android only.
  - `AdSize.smartBannerPortrait` and `AdSize.smartBannerLandscape` are only for iOS.
  - Use `Adsize.getSmartBanner(Orientation)` to get the correct value depending on platform. The
  orientation can be retrieved using a `BuildContext`:
```dart
Orientation currentOrientation = MediaQuery.of(context).orientation;
```

* Removal of `show()` for `BannerAd` and `NativeAd` since they can now be displayed within a widget
tree.
* Showing of `InterstitialAd` and `RewardedAd` should now wait for `AdListener.onAdLoaded` callback
before calling `show()` as best practice:

```dart
InterstitialAd(
  adUnitId: InterstitialAd.testAdUnitId,
  targetingInfo: targetingInfo,
  listener: (MobileAdEvent event) {
    print("InterstitialAd event $event");
  },
)
  ..load()
  ..show();
```

can be replaced by:

```dart
final InterstatialAd interstitial = InterstatialAd(
  adUnitId: InterstatialAd.testAdUnitId,
  request: AdRequest(),
  listener: AdListener(
    onAdLoaded: (Ad ad) => (ad as InterstatialAd).show(),
  ),
)..load();
```

* `Ad.load()` no longer returns a boolean that only confirms the method was called successfully.

## 0.9.3+4

* Bump Dart version requirement.

## 0.9.3+3

* Provide a default `MobileAdTargetingInfo` for `RewardedVideoAd.load()`. `RewardedVideoAd.load()`
