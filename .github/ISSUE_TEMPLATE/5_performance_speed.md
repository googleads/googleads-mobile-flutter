<!-- Thank you for using Google Mobile Ads for Flutter!

     If you have found a bug or if our documentation doesn't have an answer
     to what you're looking for, then fill out the template below. Please read
     the Flutter's team guide to filing a bug first: https://flutter.dev/docs/resources/bug-reports
-->

## Plugin Version

<!-- Please tell us the version of the plugin used in your app. -->

## Details

<!--
1.  Please tell us exactly how to reproduce the problem you are running into.

2.  Please attach a small application (ideally just one main.dart file) that
     reproduces the problem. You could use https://gist.github.com/ for this.

3.  Switch flutter to master channel and run this app on a physical device
     using profile mode as follows:
       flutter channel master

     The bleeding edge master channel is encouraged here because Flutter is
     constantly fixing bugs and improving its performance. Your problem in an
     older Flutter version may have already been solved in the master channel.

4.  Record a video of the performance issue using another phone so we
     can have an intuitive understanding of what happened. Donâ€™t use
     "adb screenrecord", as that affects the performance of the profile run.
-->

<!--
     Please tell us which target platform(s) the problem occurs (Android / iOS / Web / macOS / Linux / Windows)
     Which target OS version, for Web, browser, is the test system running?
     Does the problem occur on emulator/simulator as well as on physical devices?
