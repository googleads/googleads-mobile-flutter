<!-- Thank you for using Google Mobile Ads for Flutter!

     If you have found a bug or if our documentation doesn't have an answer
     to what you're looking for, then fill out the template below. Please read
     the Flutter's team guide to filing a bug first: https://flutter.dev/docs/resources/bug-reports
-->

## Use case

<!--
     Please tell us the problem you are running into that led to you wanting
     a new feature.

     Is your feature request related to a problem? Please give a clear and
     concise description of what the problem is.

     Describe the alternative solutions you've considered. Is there a package
     on pub.dev/flutter that already solves this?
-->

## Proposal

<!--
     Briefly but precisely describe what you would like the `google_mobile_ads` plugin to be able to do.

     Consider attaching images showing what you are imagining.

     Does this have to be provided by the plugin directly, or can it be provided
     by a package on pub.dev/flutter? If so, maybe consider implementing and
     publishing such a package rather than filing a bug.
