## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement (CLA). You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your
contribution; this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your
contributions as part of the project. Head over to
<https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see your current agreements on file or
to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## 1. Things you will need

- Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows.
- [git](https://git-scm.com) (used for source version control).
- An ssh client (used to authenticate with GitHub).
- An IDE such as [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- [`flutter_plugin_tools`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_plugin_tools) locally activated.
- [`tuneup`](https://pub.dev/packages/tuneup) locally activated.
- [`clang-format`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) (available via brew on macOS, apt on Ubuntu, maybe via llvm on chocolatey for Windows)

## 2. Forking & cloning the repository

- Ensure all the dependencies described in the previous section are installed.
- Fork `https://github.com/googleads/googleads-mobile-flutter` into your own GitHub account. If
  you already have a fork, and are now installing a development environment on
  a new machine, make sure you've updated your fork so that you don't use stale
  configuration options from long ago.
- If you haven't configured your machine with an SSH key that's known to github, then
  follow [GitHub's directions](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/)
  to generate an SSH key.
- `git clone git@github.com:<your_name_here>/googleads-mobile-flutter.git`
- `git remote add upstream git@github.com:googleads/googleads-mobile-flutter.git` (So that you
  fetch from the master repository, not your clone, when running `git fetch`
  et al.)

## 3. Environment Setup

Google Mobile Ads uses [Melos](https://github.com/invertase/melos) to manage the project and dependencies.

To install Melos, run the following command from your SSH client:

```bash
pub global activate melos
```

Next, at the root of your locally cloned repository bootstrap the projects dependencies:

```bash
melos bootstrap
```

The bootstrap command locally links all dependencies within the project without having to
provide manual [`dependency_overrides`](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/pubspec). This allows all
plugins, examples and tests to build from the local clone project.

> You do not need to run `flutter pub get` once bootstrap has been completed.

## 4. Running an example

Each plugin provides an example app which aims to showcase the main use-cases of each plugin.

To run an example, run the `flutter run` command from the `example` directory of each plugins main
directory. For example, for Firebase Auth example:

```bash
cd packages/firebase_auth/firebase_auth/example
flutter run
```

Using Melos (installed in step 3), any changes made to the plugins locally will also be reflected within all
example applications code automatically.

## 4. Running tests

FlutterFire comprises of a number of tests for each plugin, either end-to-end (e2e) or unit tests.

### Unit tests

Unit tests are responsible for ensuring expected behavior whilst developing the plugins Dart code. Unit tests do not
interact with 3rd party Firebase services, and mock where possible. To run unit tests for a specific plugin, run the
`flutter test` command from the plugins root directory. For example, Firebase Auth platform interface tests can be run
with the following commands:

```bash
cd packages/firebase_auth/firebase_auth_platform_interface
flutter test
```

### End-to-end (e2e) tests

E2e tests are those which directly communicate with Firebase, whose results cannot be mocked. These tests run directly from
an example application. To run e2e tests, run the `flutter drive` command from the plugins main `example` directory, targeting the
entry e2e test file.

> Some packages use Firebase Emulator Suite to run tests. To learn more, [visit the official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite).

```bash
cd packages/firebase_auth/firebase_auth/example
flutter drive --target=./test_driver/firebase_auth_e2e.dart
```

To run tests against web environments, run the command as a release build:

```bash
cd packages/firebase_auth/firebase_auth/example
flutter drive --target=./test_driver/firebase_auth_e2e.dart --release -d chrome
```

### Using Melos

To help aid developer workflow, Melos provides a number of commands to quickly run
tests against plugins. For example, to run all e2e tests across all plugins at once,
run the following command from the root of your cloned repository:

```bash
melos run test:e2e
```

A full list of all commands can be found within the [`melos.yaml`](https://github.com/googleads/googleads-mobile-flutter/blob/master/melos.yaml)
file.

## 5. Contributing code

We gladly accept contributions via GitHub pull requests.

Please peruse the
[Flutter style guide](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo) and
[design principles](https://flutter.io/design-principles/) before
working on anything non-trivial. These guidelines are intended to
keep the code consistent and avoid common pitfalls.

To start working on a patch:

1. `git fetch upstream`
2. `git checkout upstream/master -b <name_of_your_branch>`
3. Hack away!

Once you have made your changes, ensure that it passes the internal analyzer & formatting checks. The following
commands can be run locally to highlight any issues before committing your code:

```bash
# Run the analyze check
melos run analyze

# Format code
melos run format
```

Assuming all is successful, commit and push your code:

1. `git commit -a -m "<your informative commit message>"`
2. `git push origin <name_of_your_branch>`

To send us a pull request:

- `git pull-request` (if you are using [Hub](http://github.com/github/hub/)) or
  go to `https://github.com/googleads/googleads-mobile-flutter` and click the
  "Compare & pull request" button

Please make sure all your check-ins have detailed commit messages explaining the patch.

When naming the title of your pull request, please follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/)
guide. For example, for a fix to the Firebase Auth plugin:

`fix(firebase_auth): fixed a bug!`

Plugins tests are run automatically on contributions using GitHub Actions. Depending on
your code contributions, various tests will be run against your updated code automatically.

Once you've gotten an LGTM from a project maintainer and once your PR has received
the green light from all our automated testing, wait for one the package maintainers
to merge the pull request.

You must complete the
[Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.developers.google.com/clas).
You can do this online, and it only takes a minute.
If you've never submitted code before, you must add your (or your
organization's) name and contact info to the [AUTHORS](AUTHORS) file.

### The review process

Newly opened PRs first go through initial triage which results in one of:

- **Merging the PR** - if the PR can be quickly reviewed and looks good.
- **Closing the PR** - if the PR maintainer decides that the PR should not be merged.
- **Moving the PR to the backlog** - if the review requires non trivial effort and the issue isn't a priority; in this case the maintainer will:
  - Make sure that the PR has an associated issue labeled with "plugin".
  - Add the "backlog" label to the issue.
  - Leave a comment on the PR explaining that the review is not trivial and that the issue will be looked at according to priority order.
- **Starting a non trivial review** - if the review requires non trivial effort and the issue is a priority; in this case the maintainer will:
  - Add the "in review" label to the issue.
  - Self assign the PR.

### The release process

We push releases manually, using [Melos](https://github.com/invertase/melos)
to take care of the hard work.

Changelogs and version updates are automatically updated by a project maintainer
(via [Melos](https://github.com/invertase/melos)). The new version is automatically
generated via the commit types and changelogs via the commit messages.

Some things to keep in mind before publishing the release:

- Has CI ran on the master commit and gone green? Even if CI shows as green on
  the PR it's still possible for it to fail on merge, for multiple reasons.
  There may have been some bug in the merge that introduced new failures. CI
  runs on PRs as it's configured on their branch state, and not on tip of tree.
  CI on PRs also only runs tests for packages that it detects have been directly
  changed, vs running on every single package on master.
- [Publishing is
  forever.](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/publishing#publishing-is-forever)
  Hopefully any bugs or breaking in changes in this PR have already been caught
  in PR review, but now's a second chance to revert before anything goes live.
- "Don't deploy on a Friday." Consider carefully whether or not it's worth
  immediately publishing an update before a stretch of time where you're going
  to be unavailable. There may be bugs with the release or questions about it
  from people that immediately adopt it, and uncovering and resolving those
  support issues will take more time if you're unavailable.
